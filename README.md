Just left the theater after seeing It Feeds, and honestly? My brain's like a chaotic kaleidoscope of emotion and confusion. It's like, okay, I just spent two hours in this bizarre horror vortex and I'm not sure if I need a stiff drink, a nap, or therapy. Maybe all three? 

The plot whirled around like an over-caffeinated squirrel, jumping from one creepy scene to the next without so much as a courtesy pause. One minute it's like, Sure, things are bad, and the next, BAM! some creature's screeching in your face. Really, movie? Can we keep the screeching to a minimum? My ears haven't recovered, and I'm pretty sure my popcorn is still orbiting the moon.

The characters, though, that's a whole other can of worms. Acting was top-notch, gotta admit, but the decisions these people made—man, talk about facepalm central. It's like they were handed the 'How To Be A Horror Movie Cliché' handbook and thought, Yes, let's do precisely that! Still, there was this one girl who, albeit constantly terrified, delivered lines like her life depended on it. Which, you know, it kinda did. 

> Oh, and the vibes of this film. Somewhere between 'I-am-so-enthralled' and 'I'll-never-sleep-again', with a generous dose of 'What-on-earth-is-even-happening-right-now' thrown into the stew. If atmosphere were a soup, It Feeds would be the kind that burns your tongue but makes you go back for more.

Random side note, there was this one scene with a shadowy figure that had me thinking of that time I accidentally downloaded a virus from a dodgy website while trying to watch a movie. Just replace the sketchy pop-ups with bloodcurdling screams. Good times. 

// Random snippet of C# code because reasons
string creature = terrifying;
if (creature == terrifying) { Console.WriteLine(RUN!); }

In the end, maybe it's a brilliant metaphor for the current state of the world? Or maybe I’m overthinking it and should just download the movie when it's out, pare down to the crazy scenes, and call it a night. Either way, It Feeds got under my skin like that annoying song you can't stop humming. I can't decide if I loved it or hated it. Probably both, and I guess that's gotta count for something, right?
